# Building Agentic Systems with LLMs

After spending the last year building autonomous AI systems, I've learned that creating truly agentic systems requires more than just prompting an LLM. It's about architecting systems that can reason, plan, and execute tasks independently.

## What Makes a System "Agentic"?

An agentic system goes beyond simple question-answering. It exhibits autonomous behavior through:

- Goal-oriented planning and execution
- Dynamic tool selection and usage
- Self-reflection and error correction
- Memory and context management

## The Agency Framework

In building PlutoPredicts, I developed what I call the "Agency Framework" - a pattern for creating LLM-powered agents that can iteratively improve their predictions.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools, memory):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.memory = memory
        
    async def execute(self, task):
        plan = await self.create_plan(task)
        results = []
        
        for step in plan:
            result = await self.execute_step(step)
            self.memory.add(step, result)
            
            if not self.validate_result(result):
                revised_plan = await self.revise_plan(plan, step, result)
                plan = revised_plan
                
            results.append(result)
            
        return self.synthesize_results(results)
```

## Key Lessons Learned

Building production-ready agentic systems taught me several crucial lessons:

### 1. Tool Design is Critical

The tools you provide to your agent define its capabilities. Well-designed tools should be:

- Atomic - do one thing well
- Composable - work together seamlessly
- Failsafe - handle errors gracefully

### 2. Memory Management Matters

Agents need both short-term working memory and long-term knowledge storage. I use a hybrid approach:

```python
memory_system = {
    "working": Redis(),  # Fast, temporary storage
    "episodic": PostgreSQL(),  # Structured event history
    "semantic": VectorDB()  # Embedding-based retrieval
}
```

### 3. Observability is Non-Negotiable

When agents make autonomous decisions, you need to understand why. This led me to build TracePulse - a tool specifically for debugging agentic systems in production.

## Looking Forward

The future of software development increasingly involves AI agents working alongside humans. As we build these systems, we must focus on making them reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human intentions.

I'm currently exploring multi-agent orchestration patterns and would love to hear about your experiences building agentic systems. Feel free to reach out!
